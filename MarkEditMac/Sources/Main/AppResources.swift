/**
 To make localization work, always use `String(localized:comment:)` directly and add to this file.

 Besides, we use `xcloc` files to do the translation work:
 https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/exporting-localizations

 The only exception to not using this file for localization is the app intents,
 where we rely on `LocalizedStringResource` instead.
