MarkEdit is a free and **open-source** Markdown editor, for macOS. It's just like _TextEdit_ on Mac but dedicated to `Markdown`.

## Installation

Get `MarkEdit.dmg` from the <a href="https://github.com/MarkEdit-app/MarkEdit/releases/latest" target="_blank">latest release</a>, open it, and drag `MarkEdit.app` to `Applications`.

MarkEdit checks for updates automatically. You can also check manually via the main `MarkEdit` menu, or browse version history [here](https://github.com/MarkEdit-app/MarkEdit/releases).

If you prefer a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installation, run `brew install markedit` in your terminal and you're all set.

> We used to publish MarkEdit to the Mac App Store, [but no longer](https://github.com/MarkEdit-app/MarkEdit/wiki/Philosophy#be-a-good-macos-citizen). Don't worry about the security warning; releases are signed with a certificate from an identified developer and [notarized](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution).

## Platform Compatibility

To be focused, we only support the latest two major macOS releases. For now, they are [macOS Ventura](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/10/macos-ventura-is-now-available/) and [macOS Sonoma](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/09/macos-sonoma-is-available-today/).

Last-compatible version tags: [macos-12](https://github.com/MarkEdit-app/MarkEdit/releases/tag/macos-12).
