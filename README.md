## Building MarkEdit

### Building CoreEditor

After checking out the project, go to the root folder of the repository and run:

```
cd CoreEditor
yarn install
yarn build
```

> To test the editor in a dev environment, run `yarn dev` instead, web interfaces are exposed to `window.webModules`.

### Building MarkEditMac

After successfully building `CoreEditor`, open `MarkEdit.xcodeproj`, and build the `MarkEditMac` target.

It's recommended to override build settings by adding a `Local.xcconfig` file under the root folder, including code signing identity, development team, etc.

> Note that you should always use the latest version of Xcode.

## Testing MarkEdit Locally

Unit tests are run automatically by [GitHub actions](https://github.com/MarkEdit-app/MarkEdit/actions), you can also run them on your machine.

### Testing CoreEditor

Make sure dependencies are installed and run:

```
cd CoreEditor
yarn test
```

### Testing MarkEditMac

MarkEditMac consists of several targets, here's an example of testing `MarkEditCoreTests`:

```
xcodebuild test -project MarkEdit.xcodeproj -scheme MarkEditCoreTests -destination 'platform=macOS'
```
